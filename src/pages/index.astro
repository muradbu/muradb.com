            <p>
                I'm a tech generalist from the Netherlands with a background in
                software development.

                Since 2022 I've got a newfound passion for UNIX based systems,
                namely Linux. I really enjoy learning about its ins and outs,
                because it allows me to shape the OS to fit any of my project's
                needs. I enjoy it so much that I decided to pursue an education
                and career in infrastructure, security, devops and sysadmin.
            </p>

                Some of my hobbies include enjoying live music and playing
                electric guitar, hiking and camping, brewing and exploring
                specialty coffee, watching and reviewing movies on <a

                This is my little corner of the internet where I write about my
                adventures in tech, music, coffee, and whatever else captures my
                interest. Enjoy your stay!
